## Decision tree and Random forest

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor they would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying them back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
